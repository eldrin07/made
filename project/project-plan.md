## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Cool Down to Leaf Up: Tracking Carbon Footprints and Tree Hugs Over Two Decades

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How have carbon emissions changed over the last 20 years across different countries?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Carbon emissions are a hot topicâ€”literally! They're a key player in the warming of our planet, influencing everything from our beach vacations to winter sports. This project takes a cool dive into the past years of carbon footprints left by various countries, employing snazzy statistical analyses and vivid visualizations. The results are set to shed some light on which nations are turning down the heat and who's still burning the midnight oil. Unpacking these trends isn't just about pointing fingers; it's about sparking global conversations and fueling smarter actions against climate change. Ready to see who's been naughty or nice to Mother Earth? Let's roll up our sleeves and dig into the data!
## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1: World Bank Open Data
* Metadata URL: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.KT
* Data URL: https://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.KT?downloadformat=csv
* Data Type: CSV

Specifically, the "CO2 emissions (metric tons per capita)" dataset. The World Bank provides various environmental datasets including historical carbon emissions by country.

### Datasource1: Global Carbon Atlas
